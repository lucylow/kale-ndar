# KALE-ndar: Hackathon Submission Guide

## üéØ **Project Overview**

**KALE-ndar** is a decentralized prediction market platform that perfectly demonstrates the hackathon's theme of composability by combining:

- **KALE Protocol**: Proof-of-teamwork asset for staking and betting
- **Reflector Oracle**: Reliable price feeds for market resolution
- **Soroban Smart Contracts**: Advanced prediction market logic

### **Why This is a Winning Submission**

1. **True Composability**: Not just "a KALE app" or "a Reflector app" - it's a new product requiring both
2. **Leverages Core Strengths**: KALE's gamified farming + Reflector's reliable data
3. **High Engagement**: Prediction markets naturally attract communities
4. **Demonstrable MVP**: Clean UI for market creation, betting, and resolution

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture**

### **Smart Contracts (Phase 1)**

#### **1. Market Factory Contract** (`contracts/market-factory/`)
- **Function**: `create_market()` - Deploys new prediction market instances
- **Key Features**: 
  - Takes KALE fee to prevent spam
  - Validates market parameters
  - Emits market creation events
  - Manages market registry

#### **2. Prediction Market Contract** (`contracts/prediction-market/`)
- **Core Functions**:
  - `bet(side, amount)` - Place KALE bets on YES/NO outcomes
  - `resolve()` - Permissionless resolution using Reflector oracle
  - `claim_winnings()` - Distribute rewards to winners
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time bet tracking
  - Oracle integration for resolution
  - Proportional reward distribution
  - Event emission for frontend updates

#### **3. KALE Integration Contract** (`contracts/kale-integration/`)
- **Core Functions**:
  - `plant(amount)` - Stake KALE tokens
  - `work(nonce, entropy)` - Proof-of-teamwork mining
  - `harvest()` - Claim accumulated rewards
- **Key Features**:
  - APY calculation and tracking
  - Staking statistics
  - Reward distribution system

#### **4. Reflector Oracle Contract** (`contracts/reflector-oracle/`)
- **Core Functions**:
  - `get_price(asset)` - Get latest price feeds
  - `get_twap(asset, periods)` - Time-weighted average prices
  - `is_price_available(asset)` - Check data freshness
- **Key Features**:
  - Multi-oracle redundancy
  - Confidence scoring
  - Price staleness checks

### **Frontend Implementation (Phase 2)**

#### **Core Services**
- **`src/services/contracts.ts`**: Direct smart contract interactions
- **`src/services/reflector-oracle.ts`**: Oracle price feed management
- **`src/services/kale-integration.ts`**: KALE staking and farming
- **`src/services/blockchain.ts`**: High-level blockchain operations

#### **Key Components**
- **`src/components/MarketList.tsx`**: Real-time market display
- **`src/components/MarketCreation.tsx`**: Market creation with "one-click" harvest & bet
- **`src/components/KaleStaking.tsx`**: Complete staking dashboard
- **`src/components/WalletConnector.tsx`**: Freighter wallet integration

## üöÄ **Deployment & Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
```bash
# Install Rust and Soroban CLI
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
cargo install --locked soroban-cli --features opt

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

### **Contract Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy to testnet
chmod +x scripts/deploy-contracts.sh
./scripts/deploy-contracts.sh

# This will:
# 1. Build all contracts
# 2. Deploy to Stellar testnet
# 3. Initialize contracts with proper configuration
# 4. Create .env.local with contract addresses
# 5. Test deployment
```

### **Frontend Setup**
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## üéÆ **Demo Flow**

### **1. Market Creation (60s)**
- Connect Freighter wallet
- Navigate to "Create Market"
- Fill in market details:
  - Event: "Will KALE reach $1.00 by December 31, 2025?"
  - Asset: KALE
  - Target Price: $1.00
  - Condition: Above
  - Resolution Time: Dec 31, 2025
- Use "One-Click Harvest & Bet" feature
- Pay small KALE fee to create market

### **2. Betting Phase (60s)**
- View active markets on homepage
- Click "Place Prediction" on a market
- Choose YES or NO outcome
- Enter KALE amount (e.g., 100 KALE)
- Confirm transaction
- Watch real-time totals update

### **3. Resolution & Payout (30s)**
- Wait for resolution time to pass
- Anyone can call `resolve()` function
- Contract queries Reflector oracle for final price
- Winners can claim their KALE rewards
- Show transaction history and balances

## üéØ **Demo Script**

### **Introduction (30s)**
"Welcome to KALE-ndar, a prediction market that combines KALE Protocol's proof-of-teamwork mechanics with Reflector Oracle's reliable price feeds. Users can farm KALE tokens and then use them to bet on real-world events."

### **Market Creation (60s)**
"I'm creating a new market to predict if KALE will reach $1.00 by the end of 2025. Notice how I can harvest my farming rewards and immediately use them to create this market - that's the power of composability."

### **Betting Demonstration (60s)**
"Now I'm placing a 100 KALE bet on YES. Here's another wallet betting NO. You can see the totals updating in real-time. The entire platform uses KALE as the native currency."

### **Resolution & Payout (30s)**
"When it's time to resolve, anyone can trigger the contract. It uses Reflector Oracle to get the real price, settles automatically, and winners can claim their KALE rewards. It's DeFi fun, powered by teamwork."
